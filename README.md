# About
This repo contains my Rust solutions to the Advent of code 2020.

I'm a beginner in Rust (I haven't even finished the first half of "The Rust programming language" book) and I'm using this event as a way to improve my Rust skills.

You won't find here performant solutions and most probably I won't finish all days.
